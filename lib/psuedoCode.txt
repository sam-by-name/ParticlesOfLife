Psuedo code for scalling cell/board size according to window resize, to fill the screen.

The idea is, to get the dimensions of the board and the innerwindow and to make sure the board
is oriented such that its longest side flows along the longest dimension of the innerwindow
and to make each cell to be as large as possible, whilst keeping the board centered and within bounds

// Originally I used : cell = small length of window / larger length of board.
// This works just fine for square boards, but not rectangle boards (no duh!).

function () {
get larger length of board
get smaller length of board

get larger length of window
get smaller length of window

let cellA = small length of window / small length of board
let cellB = large length of window / large length of board

if cellB >= cellA, use cellA, else use cellB // actually it does not work

}
// the above would mean the smaller side of the board does not exceed it's avalable space.
// but it does not maximize the available screen space used by the board
